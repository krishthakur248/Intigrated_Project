                    <h3>Propose an Exchange</h3>
                    <p>When you find someone with a skill you want to learn (who might also want to learn something from you), send them an exchange proposal. Define what you want to learn and what you can teach in return.</p>

        <h2>Exchange Models</h2>
        <p>SkillXchange offers different ways to exchange skills:</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>Direct Exchange</h3>
            <p>You teach something to the same person who teaches you something in return. For example, you teach photography while they teach you cooking.</p>

            <h3>Community Exchange</h3>
            <p>You teach Person A, Person A teaches Person B, and Person B teaches you. This creates a community chain of skill sharing.</p>

            <h3>Credit System</h3>
            <p>You earn credits by teaching and spend them to learn from others. This works well when you don't have a direct skill match with someone.</p>
